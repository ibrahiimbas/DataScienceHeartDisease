# Data Science Heart Disease Analysis
Data science and analyze of heart attack disease project for my Data Science with Python lecture <br/>
# Description:
The Heart Attack Dataset is a dataset created using data from Zheen Hospital, located in Erbil, Iraq. This dataset contains records of heart attack cases and their details, collected between January 2019 and May 2019 at Zheen Hospital. The features of this dataset include age, gender, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar, CK-MB, and troponin levels with either a negative or positive outcome. The gender column is set to 1 if the recorded patient is male and 0 if female. <br/>  <br/>
This project was carried out using the Python programming language to strengthen my skills in data science. Various libraries were used to perform data science analysis applications. A model was created using the data from the dataset, and different regression and other analytical methods were applied to examine it. The results obtained from each regression were compared with one another. This project serves as an introductory project to data science using Python. <br/><br/>
