# Data Science Heart Disease Analysis
Data science and analyze of heart attack disease project for my Data Science with Python lecture <br/>
# Description:
### Dataset Description:
The heart attack datasets were collected at Zheen hospital in Erbil, Iraq, from January 2019 to May 2019. The attributes of this dataset are: age, gender, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar, ck-mb and troponin with negative or positive output. According to the provided information, the medical dataset classifies either heart attack or none. The gender column in the data is normalized: the male is set to 1 and the female to 0. The glucose column is set to 1 if it is > 120; otherwise, 0. As for the output, positive is set to 1 and negative to 0. <br/> <br/>

### Project Description: 
This project was carried out using the Python programming language to strengthen my skills in data science. Various libraries were used to perform data science analysis applications. A model was created using datas from the dataset, and different regression and other methods were applied to analyze it. Additionally, the results were visualized through graphs. The outcomes of each regression method were compared with one another. This project serves as an introductory project to data science using Python. <br/><br/>
